# Subject-Interests

We compare 5 subjects which are very common amongst students in San Francisco,CA. We import the file and make a tabular representation. These include Data Analytics,
Deep Learning, Big Data using Spark or Hadoop, Data Visualization and Data Journalism. We plot the graph between people who are very interested ,somewhat interested
and those who are not at all interested. 

The remaining half shows a map of San Francisco with the crime rates at various places and various intensities. We imported folium and by installing geopy we were
able to get a map with required plotting of data.
